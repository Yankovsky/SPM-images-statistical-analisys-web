        Here is the tool which you can use for statistical analysis of different images (originally for AFM topography
        images).
    </p>

    <p>
        Images should be uploaded in ASCII files, which for example can be produced by <a href="http://gwyddion.net/">Gwyddion</a>.
        Top menu will guide you in uploading your matrix, choosing best filter for your image and adjusting threshold in
        the filtered image for finding objects which have to be analyzed.
        Than you can download information about lateral sizes (in pixels), height (difference between base plane and
        maximum of object contrast) and nearest neighbor.
